                    My journey in tech started in 2018 with learning

                <p>
                    My interest in cybersecurity has led me to become proficient with

                    I can pretty much read every programming language as they all have common keywords and structure.
                    I also came across some interesting effective

                <p>I've been an Information and Communication Technology enthusiast from the day I was born.
                    My first computer was a Windows machine which I have always been amazed by. Everytime
                    I started it up, I kept discovering new subjects & abilities and, ofcourse, playing games on it.
                </p>
                <strong class="strong-title">Roblox</strong>
                <p>
                    When I first played the game Roblox (I was really young), I was always wondering where
                    these
                    games came from. Did Roblox make them? Did they hire other companies? Is it <strong>User
                        Generated</strong>?
                    I quickly discovered how they were made and wanted to make my own game, not to earn money or gain
                    players, just to see how it works and what you can do with it. I have always been curious, ambitious
                    and eager to learn
                    which led me to the knowledge I've gained now. So I was exploring around, pulling
                    free models from the toolbox,
                    watching tutorials, making terrain and everything that was available, but I never actually made
                    anything
                    myself, until I saw and opened a "Script" in the add menu. I searched it up and a whole new world
                    was
                    just discovered, "Programming". I went to the free models and tried to read other made scripts,
                    watching
                    youtube tutorials and trying to puzzle. I searched some words up on google and found their
                    documentation
                    and forum where you can ask questions regarding the whole Roblox platform that I highly made use of.
                    I made
                    some basic scripts and really enjoyed it. I made several games and got hired for military groups,
                    crappy
                    simulators, tycoons etcetera but never actually asked for money, I just find it fun to make games.
                    Then suddenly on a day when I was playing
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5118029260/Plaza-Connect">plaza connect</a>,
                    a random dude came to
                    me and asked me if I could script something for him, I was really confused because how could he know
                    that I
                    was a programmer. He said he would pay me 200 robux which for me at that time was a lot.
                    He wanted me to make a dialogue interaction where if you chat with a NPC and chat back another NPC
                    will spawn.
                    I was really excited and started immediately. I searched it up, followed the documentation, made
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5182067652/dialog-script">the game</a> and
                    sended
                    it to him. He said it was brilliant and paid me immediately. After that time, I became an official
                    developer.
                    I like playing the games as well as making the games. I had awesome classmates and a cousin
                    that also liked playing Roblox and my games together. I was really addicted to it, but also watching
                    it.
                </p>
                <strong class="strong-title">YouTube</strong>
                <p>
                    When you are boring yourself or want a visual explanation of something, it always comes down to the
                    same thing.
                    YouTube. I really looked up to the content creators and just like the roblox games,
                    I wanted to make my own. I made a channel, recorded my first video, stole a thumbnail and hit that
                    upload button. Ready and waiting for the 1 million views, but... that didn't work out, as expected.
                    I didn't gave up yet and tried it again, but only gained 3 views, which was me, my mother, and my
                    cousin
                    which I told I will be famous the next day. I didn't understand how all these other youtubers did
                    it.
                    I watched some videos on how to gain more views and statistics and got some good tips from the
                    channels
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@vidIQ">VidIq</a>,
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Marcus-Jones">Marcus Jones</a> and
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@finzar">finzar</a> where it came down that I had
                    to edit my
                    videos and thumbnails. And that brought me to Premiere Pro, After Effects and Adobe Photoshop or the
                    free
                    version photopea. Just like Programming, I searched up how to do this, how to make that, etcetera.
                    After some years coming back and
                    giving up I was well experienced. Then one of my videos blew up and
                    got almost 400k views, I quickly gained YouTube partnership and made money. But making these videos
                    take
                    way too much time for me and I don't want to pay for editors, how can I automate this?

                <strong class="strong-title">Python</strong>
                <p>
                    I know there could be a work around, I don't want to do this all manually, I just don't have the
                    time and
                    motivation for it, so again, I searched it up. Python3, it said. I possess a basic
                    programming language so it went really quickly learning all the things, but I find it a much better
                    language as you can actually use this elsewhere than only games, you can use this for everything.
                    I made a really complex program with over 300 lines of code. It used the YouTube API, the browser
                    inputs,
                    scheduling, etcetera.
                    It was a real success. I know you could do a lot more than this, and made a cheat/macro for a Harry
                    Potter
                    spell fighting game with over 200 lines of code, a text hider in image files, projects my friends
                    needed, and other stuff. After that I returned back to Roblox. My current interest always varies.
                    When
                    I was back at playing games I wanted to do something creative, design something. I knew what I
                    wanted,
                    I wanted to make something like
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/i5k-3d-artistgraphic-designer/220428">I5K</a>
                    did.

                <strong class="strong-title">Blender & Unreal Engine 5</strong>
                <p>
                    At this time, I got a new computer with an RTX 3080 for only 400 euros, I7 12700KF and other amazing
                    specifications.
                    Just like always, I searched things up, came across Blender and installed it, and downloaded some
                    models.
                    My first results were terrible, and I was bad at making things realistic. Even with the kits I
                    downloaded
                    for Photoshop. So I searched further. And then I found UE5, the beauty of realism. It costed me
                    30GBs of
                    storage but that wasn't a problem for my 1TB SSD and 3TB HDD. I made some projects, learned how to
                    make
                    realistic designs, and those are the results.

                <p>
                    I showed this to a couple people, and got some expensive commissions. I stopped really quick with this phase.
                    This was more in the time I was listening more music, as I found out that Trap, Rap, EDM, Metal and Dubstep
                    was my favourite music. So you probably know what's gonna happen next.

                <p>
                    At this time, I thought this is gonna be easy. I mean, if you listen music all the time and even sing
                    improvements in your head, this should be a giveaway. I installed the programs, did what I always did,
                    and started making beats. At first, it sounded good. But the next day you come back and listen to it, it
                    sounds terrible. Sometimes I had times where I was really productive, but I never had it when I was behind
                    my monitor. My biggest problem is making the sound that was in my head. I'm really critical when it comes
                    to music, so I made it really hard for me. I made some good songs and some bad songs, it depends on what you
                    expect.
