                <br>

                <p>
                    My journey in tech started in 2018 with learning

                </p>
                <p>
                    My interest in cybersecurity has led me to become proficient with

                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.torproject.org/">The Onion Router Project</a>. I have created

                    I can pretty much read every programming language as they all have common keywords and structure.
                    I also came across some interesting, effective
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_intelligence">OSINT</a> resources
                    along with several <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach">Data

                    databases,
                    dark web forums, services, and other cybersecurity-related ends. After that, I honed my skills in
                    website
                    penetration testing, mastering techniques such as

                    My interests have also led me to system and network administration, where I completed a one-year
                    comprehensive course on
                    Windows Server. I learned about

                <h1 class="center">MY STORY</h1>
                <p>I've been an Information and Communication Technology enthusiast from the day I was born.
                    My first computer was a Windows machine which I have always been amazed by. Every time
                    I started it up, I kept discovering new subjects and abilities, and of course, playing games on it.
                </p>
                <strong class="strong-title">Roblox</strong>
                <p>
                    When I first played the game Roblox (I was young), I was always wondering where
                    these
                    games came from. Did Roblox make them? Did they hire other companies? Is it user-generated?
                    I quickly discovered how they were made and wanted to make my own game, not to earn money or gain
                    players, but just to see how it works and what you can do with it. I have always been curious, ambitious,
                    and eager to learn
                    which led me to the knowledge I've gained so far. So I was exploring around. Pulling
                    free models from the toolbox, 
                    watching tutorials, making terrain, and everything available. But I never actually made
                    anything
                    myself. Until I saw and opened the "Script" in the add menu. I searched it up and a whole new world
                    was
                    just discovered. "Programming". I went to the free models and tried to read other made scripts,
                    watch
                    YouTube tutorials, and try to puzzle. I searched up some words on Google and found their
                    documentation
                    and forum where you can ask questions regarding the whole Roblox platform, which I highly made use
                    of.
                    I made
                    some basic scripts and enjoyed it. I made several games and got hired for military groups,
                    crappy
                    simulators, tycoons etcetera. I never actually asked for money, I just find it fun to make games.
                    Then, suddenly, on a day when I was playing
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5118029260/Plaza-Connect">Plaza Connect</a>,
                    a random dude came to
                    me and asked me if I could script something for him. I was confused because how could he know
                    that I
                    was a programmer? He said he would pay me.
                    He wanted me to make a dialogue interaction where if you chat with an NPC and chat back, another NPC
                    will spawn.
                    I was excited and started immediately. I searched it up, followed the documentation, made
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5182067652/dialog-script">the game</a>, and
                    sent
                    it to him. He said it was brilliant and paid me immediately. After that time, I became an official
                    developer.
                    I like playing the games as well as making the games. I had awesome classmates and a cousin
                    who also liked playing Roblox and my games together. I was addicted to it, but also watching
                    it.

                <strong class="strong-title">YouTube</strong>
                <p>
                    When you are boring yourself or just want a visual explanation of something, it always comes down to
                    the
                    same thing.
                    YouTube. I looked up to the content creators. And just like the Roblox games,
                    I wanted to make my own. I made a channel, recorded my first video, stole a thumbnail, and hit that
                    upload button. Ready and waiting for the 1 million views. But... that didn't work out. As expected.
                    I didn't give up yet and tried it again, this time I only gained 3 views, which were me, my mother,
                    and my
                    cousin
                    which I told I would be famous the next day. I didn't understand how all these other YouTubers did
                    it.
                    I watched some videos on how to gain more views and statistics and got some good tips from the
                    channels
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@vidIQ">VidIq</a>,
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Marcus-Jones">Marcus Jones</a>, and
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@finzar">Finzar</a> where it came down that I had
                    to edit my
                    videos and thumbnails. That brought me to Premiere Pro, After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, and the
                    free
                    version, Photopea. Just like Programming, I searched up how to do this, how to make that, etcetera.
                    After some years of coming back and
                    giving up, I was well experienced. Then one of my videos blew up and
                    got almost 400k views, I quickly gained a YouTube partnership and made money. But making these videos
                    takes
                    way too much time for me and I don't want to make use of other video editors, how can I automate this?
                </p>
                <strong class="strong-title">Python</strong>
                <p>
                    I know there could be a workaround. I don't want to do this all manually, I just don't have the
                    time and
                    motivation for it. So again, I searched it up and Python was the first result. I possess a basic
                    programming language so I quickly learned all the things. I find it a much better
                    language as you can use this elsewhere than only games, you can use this for everything.
                    I made a complex program with over hundreds lines of code. I used the YouTube API, the browser
                    inputs,
                    scheduling, etcetera.
                    It was a real success. I know you could do a lot more with this, and made a cheat/macro for a Harry
                    Potter
                    spell-fighting game, a text hider in image files, projects my friends
                    needed, and other stuff. After that, I returned to Roblox. My current interest always varies.
                    When
                    I was back at playing games I wanted to do something creative, design something. I knew what I
                    wanted,
                    I wanted to make something like
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/i5k-3d-artistgraphic-designer/220428">I5K</a>
                    did.
                </p>
                <strong class="strong-title">Blender & Unreal Engine 5</strong>
                <p>
                    At this time, I got a new computer with very good specifications.
                    Just like always, I searched things up, came across Blender, installed it, and downloaded some
                    models.
                    My first results were terrible, and I was bad at making things realistic. Even with the kits I
                    downloaded
                    for Photoshop. So I searched further. And then I found UE5, the beauty of realism. It cost me
                    30GBs of
                    storage. I made some projects, learned how to
                    make
                    realistic designs, and got the results.

                    I showed this to a couple of people and got some expensive commissions. I stopped quickly with
                    this phase.
                    This was more in the time I was listening to music. You probably know what's gonna happen next.
                </p>
                <strong class="strong-title">Audition & FL Studio</strong>
                <p>
                    Right now, I thought this was gonna be easy. I mean, if you listen to music all the time and even
                    sing
                    improvements in your head, this should be a giveaway. I installed the programs, did what I always
                    did,
                    and started making music. At first, it sounded good. But the next day I came back and listened to
                    it,
                    it
                    sounded terrible. Sometimes I had times where I was productive, but I never had it when I was
                    behind
                    my monitor. My biggest problem was making the sound that was in my head. I'm critical when it
                    comes
                    to music, so it was hard for me. I made some good songs and bad ones, it depends on
                    what you expect. After a while, I stopped. I always change projects from time to time. Sometimes I
                    do
                    this, and other times, I do that. After that, a school year passed and I got a new interesting
                    friend who had a website. Here we go again.
                </p>
                <strong class="strong-title">Web Development</strong>
                <p>
                    I asked how he made it. He explained to me the whole process and how he did it. He
                    had his
                    server with full stack development. He just port-forwarded his router to his website, which
                    resulted in us
                    having to go to his IP to visit his website, which was quite funny. He gave me his back-end which I
                    studied
                    and improved. I also followed some courses online for NodeJs with ExpressJs, HTML, JavaScript,
                    and CSS.
                    I did a whole design with colors that changed every time you refresh the page with a secret color, a
                    line/bar
                    that glides from corners, a moving background according to your mouse with a fading effect, a light
                    that follows your mouse with a smooth delay, hover effects, and other animations. You could make an
                    account, visit cool websites, play games, and
                    more. You needed to do a whole secret puzzle to unlock your account to access more
                    things.
                    My classmates loved it and even the teachers made an account.

                    I hosted it on a local server as well but behind a CloudFlared reverse proxy tunnel. So my IP wasn't
                    leaked.
                    After that, my father was worried that it was gonna become a popular and heavy website and began to worry about our privacy.
                    I just searched days after VPS services and tried multiple out. For other sites I made, I went
                    for
                    static websites as I didn't have to care about a server or back-end, which I searched up as well.
                    In this phase,
                    I've come across some cybersecurity terms such as cryptography, protocols, and more, which is a
                    perfect
                    segway to the next phase.

                <strong class="strong-title">CyberSecurity</strong>
                <p>
                    If I look at what I've learned now, ICT is just a big puzzle, it's all connected. There wasn't
                    a reason why I switched to this new topic,
                    I just found it interesting. I like tinkering with things and then finding new things out. It's
                    also mostly in the news when there's a new data breach or when a company gets infected with ransomware.
                    I searched up some terms that people act like or think they know, such as HTTPS, hacking, cryptocurrencies
                    such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, and a bunch of other topics that I must think of day to day. It was 
                    a bit confusing as when you search for an unknown term, you get an explanation with more unknown
                    terms, kind of like a rabbit hole. I found it interesting and went deeper and deeper. Until
                    I found a topic of how hacking/exploiting works, that was for me the cherry on the top. I switched to hacking
                    and wanted to access the "Dark Web". To understand how you need to hack things, you first
                    need to understand how they work, and even further, understand the source code better than the
                    makers. But that is not always needed, as I started as a script kiddie and used already publicly made
                    exploits. I installed and tried multiple hacker machines and tested some exploits. I thought,
                    wow, this is powerful. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. I went
                    from website to software penetration testing and followed some good online courses. You could even
                    get paid to hack other people's and companies' devices for money, which is called, an ethical
                    hacker or a blue hat hacker. It was cool and even hacked my dad's computer. And then I
                    realized that nothing is safe. I was more aware of my privacy, which is
                    a perfect reason to find out what the dark web is. So, in my experience, the "dark web"
                    is just a website that has a malicious or illegal intents, such as hiring hackers or hitmen,
                    buying drugs/weapons/children/organs, seeing studies from illegal experiments, hidden newspapers and blogs,
                    CP, forums/databases, and more. It was weird seeing all these things publicly available.
                    Most dark websites are on deep websites, which just means you can't visit them with
                    your normal browser like Chrome/Edge/Opera/Firefox/etc but have to use another secure private
                    browser like Tor. While searching for all these things, I also found some quality Open Source
                    Intelligence such as finding a person by picture, finding publicly accessible cameras and
                    other devices, finding the person with an address from a phone number, and more. After that, I made
                    multiple malware and exploits along using other tools and specializing further in advanced cybersecurity.

                <strong class="strong-title">System and Network Administration</strong>
                <p>
                    I was following industrial electricity in school and didn't like it at all. I liked the theory,
                    but not the practical. During these years I've seen that I was more interested in computers.
                    So I changed schools. I could choose between a variation of ICT subjects but have chosen
                    the topic that I am talking about right now. I didn't choose any of the others because I already
                    have seen them and don't want to repeat them from the beginning. Not because I think I already know
                    everything about it, but because I will be demotivated and called a nerd. I also thought that
                    this topic is more of a center of ICT where you need from everything a good base. I finally learned
                    the thing that I wanted to learn. I did the year, and it was awesome. I not only learned everything
                    from Windows Server but also made friends with the same interests.

                    is an unfinished Half-life 2-inspired variant but more focused on combat. The concept was that you can choose 3 teams.

                    gain special abilities like healing or leading, other weapons, and vehicle hijacking. Combine: gain
                    access
                    to vehicles like helicopters, APCs, devices like manhaks, scanners, and more, and earn other
                    weapons.

                <br> <br>

                <strong class="strong-title">What services do you provide?</strong>
                <p>
                    I can program you whole Roblox games, programs & scripts, and static websites.
                </p> <br>

                <strong class="strong-title">What can you make on Roblox?</strong>
                <p>
                    I can make almost everything as long as it doesn't come to these anime effects or math-heavy
                    algorithms. Some common
                    examples are an advanced TPS (Third Person Shooter) gun system with real bullets fully optimized,
                    Round systems,
                    menus, complex NPCs, and more.
                </p> <br>

                <strong class="strong-title">What is your time zone?</strong>
                <p>
                    I live in Belgium so my timezone is CEST/GMT+1. The time for me currently is
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cest+time">this</a>.
                </p> <br>

                <strong class="strong-title">When are you available?</strong>
                <p>
                    I can work almost every week. However, you can
                    contact me 24/7.
                </p> <br>

                <strong class="strong-title">How much do you charge?</strong>
                <p>
                    You might not like the answer and heard it a lot, but it depends on the task. There isn't a "one
                    price for all"
                    thing. But I can give you a good representation. The lowest I generally go is 10 euros for a task
                    that takes
                    less than an hour, and 100 euros that takes two days. It also depends on the complexity, a one-hour
                    task
                    can cost more than usual.
                </p> <br>

                <strong class="strong-title">What payment method do you accept?</strong>
                <p>
                    I only accept euros through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> per task.
                    If
                    you can not
                    pay with euro's, then I do accept Robux but 3 times more. I do not accept percentages.
                </p> <br>

                <strong class="strong-title">Why do you only accept PayPal?</strong>
                <p>
                    The reason is that I can't do anything with Robux. It's just a virtual currency that you can only
                    do one
                    thing with, kind of like a gift card for Walmart. I am not a child anymore and have a life in the
                    real
                    world. I am trying to make this a semi-job.
                </p> <br>

                <strong class="strong-title">How does the process work?</strong>
                <p>
                    So when you contact me, I will reply ASAP and maybe ask you some questions. If you need a script,
                    please be as clear
                    as possible and explain every detail. I do not add things up that I don't think you asked/needed. We
                    will
                    negotiate the price beforehand and once everything is ready I start on the project. I am not a GUI
                    designer
                    nor a builder which means I don't make them. If I am missing elements then I add them myself but
                    don't expect
                    great results then.
                </p> <br>

                <strong class="strong-title">How can I contact you?</strong>
                <p>
                    You can contact me on Discord, my user is <a
